# whfrp2_char_gen
A character generator for Warhammer Fantasy Role Play 2nd edition.

## About the Project
Character creation in RPGs is great fun, but it can be tiring especially when creating player characters for a single session or NPCs. 
The goal of this project is to create an application in python3 for generating random characters in WHFRP 2ed.
The concept is to get a completed random character sheet according to the rules in the manual in a few clicks.
The application is for self-development and is for personal use only.
The application creates a character sheet in Polish.
